          There are two parts to Twitlist, the <strong>extension</strong>, and
          the <strong>website</strong>.
        </p>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
          <li>
            <h3>Install the extension.</h3>

              >Download the extension here.</a
            >
            You need to be using the Chrome browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Find the extension icon.</h3>
            <p>
              Once the extension has been installed,
              <strong>go to twitter.com</strong> and then look for this icon in
              your top bar:
            </p>
            <img src="/images/twitlist_128.png" width="32" height="32" />
            <p>
              Note that this icon won't appear if you're on any other website!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Log in to the extension.</h3>
            <p>
              Click on the icon to open a popup. The popup will contain a green
              button asking you to "sign in with Twitter".
            </p>
            <img src="/images/crx-login.png" />
            <p>
              Do it! A large popup will open to do the login.</p>
              <img src="/images/login-popup.png" />
              <p>I swear I am not reading your Twitter account.  That's the minimal amount
                of permissions I'm allowed to set the app to by Twitter.  All I'm using
                your account for is to log in and verify you're you.  Anyway, when it's done,
              it'll go away and you should be logged in.
            </p>

            <h3>Check that the extension is working.</h3>
            <p>
              Every tweet should have a little rectangular box under the
              person's name that says "add a note about this user".
            </p>
            <img src="/images/content-script-ui-1.png" />
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Go to the website.</h3>
            <p>
              To add your first note, click on any "add a note about this user"
              link under a user's name. This will take you to the website
              (twitlist.net). If it's your first time, and it should be, you
              will be asked to log in again.
            </p>
            <img src="/images/website-login.png" />
            <p>
              Sorry about that, but it can't be helped, a website and an
              extension are two different things. Going forward you probably
              won't have to log in again, unless you deliberately log out.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Add a note.</h3>
            <p>
              Type your note about this user in the large input box, and click
              "add note".
            </p>
            <img src="/images/add-note-ui-1.png" />
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Check that it worked.</h3>
            <p>
              It should have added the first row to your list.
            </p>
            <img src="/images/add-note-ui-2.png" />
            <p>
              Also, if you go back to your Twitter tab, this note should appear
              on this user's tweets.
            </p>

            <h3>Set sharing options.</h3>
            <p>
              Lists are set to private by default, which means no one else can
              see your list. At the bottom, it should say, "This list can be
              seen by" and the selected option should be "nobody". The options
              are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>nobody</strong> This is the default.</li>
              <li>
                <strong>certain users (listed below)</strong> You can share the
                list with other users by adding them in the "share with" box at
                the bottom of this section. You need to use their Twitter handle
                and they need to have registered with Twitlist. If they haven't,
                you can still add their Twitter handle and they'll be eligible
                to see your shared list as soon as they sign up.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>everybody</strong> You'll get a public link to share
                this list with anyone who visits that link.
              </li>

            <p>
              Honestly, I've seen a lot of people retweet very bad people
              because they've forgotten who that person is. However, this can be
              used for many positive purposes such as:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Remembering why you followed someone.</li>
              <li>
                Remembering who someone is (journalist? comedian?) despite their
                useless whimsical bio.
              </li>
              <li>Telling two similar people apart.</li>
              <li>
                Keeping track of people who keep screwing around with holiday
                themed names.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sharing useful info about who someone is, or why they are
                famous, with your friends.

                Chrome (desktop): This extension only works if/when you are
                browsing Twitter in the Chrome browser, on desktop. It won't
                work on the Twitter iPhone or Android apps, and it won't work in
                the Chrome browser on a phone.
              </li>
              <li>
                To create and save a list, you will need a Twitter account.

          <h2 class="question">
            Can I just sign up on the website and not use the extension?
          </h2>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              Sure, signing up on the website lets you look at other people's
              lists they've shared with you. Anyone can look at public lists
              ("shared with everyone") without having an account.
            </p>
            <p>
              There's no UI to manually add entries if you're not coming from
              the extension but you could do it by messing around with the URL
              params. May add a UI for this in the future.

          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              I added that functionality but it's very tricky and I'm afraid
              something may go wrong. Maybe after all the existing bugs have
              been worked out!

              That seems like a lot of trouble.

          <h2 class="question">What data are you collecting??</h2>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              I'm collecting your twitter username and linking it to your
              twitlist account.  I am also collecting all the notes you make
              on this app,
              obviously.  I am not reading anything on your Twitter account.
              I know the login says I have access to your tweets and DMs but
              despite the fact I only want to use Twitter login verification
              and get your screenname, reading your account is the minimal
              amount of permissions a Twitter-integrated app can ask for.
