        <p>
          There are two parts to Twitlist, the <strong>extension</strong>, and
          the <strong>website</strong>.
        </p>
        <ol class="instruction-list">

            <h3>Install the extension.</h3>
            <a
              href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitlist/bgglepaoaihanaglaconkiinkppimbjk"
              >Download the extension here.</a
            >
            You need to be using the Chrome browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Find the extension icon.</h3>
            <p>
              Once the extension has been installed,
              <strong>go to twitter.com</strong> and then look for this icon in
              your top bar:
            </p>
            <img src="/images/twitlist_128.png" width="32" height="32" />
            <p>
              Note that this icon won't appear if you're on any other website!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Log in to the extension.</h3>
            <p>
              Click on the icon to open a popup. The popup will contain a green
              button asking you to "sign in with Twitter".
            </p>
            <img src="/images/crx-login.png" />
            <p>
              Do it! A large popup will open to do the login.
            </p>
            <img src="/images/login-popup.png" />
            <p>
              I swear I am not reading your Twitter account. That's the minimal
              amount of permissions I'm allowed to set the app to by Twitter.
              All I'm using your account for is to log in and verify you're you.
              Anyway, when it's done, it'll go away and you should be logged in.
            </p>
            <img src="/images/crx-logged-in.png" />
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Add a note.</h3>
            <p>
              Every tweet should have a little purple plus icon next to the
              person's name. When you hover on the plus, a box will appear below
              it saying "click to add a note about this user".
            </p>
            <img src="/images/add-note-ui-1.png" />
            <p>
              Click the plus and the box will turn into a form allowing you to
              add a new note:
            </p>
            <img src="/images/add-note-ui-2.png" />
            <p>
              Type in your note and click "save":
            </p>
            <img src="/images/add-note-ui-3.png" />
            <p>
              Now the note should appear on hover, and the plus icon should turn
              into a list icon, which indicates this is a user you've added a
              note for.
            </p>

          <h2 class="question">Logging on to the website.</h2>
          <p>
            To view a list of your notes, delete notes, or share your list with
            other people, go to the website. (This will open another tab,
            separate from your Twitter tab.) You can go there by clicking the
            "manage notes" link in the add/edit note form on each tweet or the
            "Manage your list (opens web page)" link in the settings.
          </p>
          <p><img src="/images/manage-notes-1.png" /></p>
          <p><img src="/images/manage-notes-2.png" /></p>
          <p>
            This will take you to the website (twitlist.net). If it's your first
            time, and it should be, you will be asked to log in again.
          </p>
          <img src="/images/website-login.png" />
          <p>
            Sorry about that, but it can't be helped, a website and an extension
            are two different things. Going forward you probably won't have to
            log in again, unless you deliberately log out.

          <h2 class="question">Editing and deleting notes.</h2>
          <p>
            The first section should be a list of your notes. Click "edit" or
            "delete" next to any note to edit or delete it.
          </p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 class="question">Setting sharing options.</h2>
          <p>
            Lists are set to private by default, which means no one else can see
            your list. At the bottom, it should say, "This list can be seen by"
            and the selected option should be "nobody". The options are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>nobody</strong></p>
              <p>This is the default.</p>
              <img src="/images/shared-nobody.png" />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>certain users (listed below)</strong></p>
              <p>
                You can share the list with other users by adding them in the
                "share with" box at the bottom of this section. You need to use
                their Twitter handle and they need to have registered with
                Twitlist. If they haven't, you can still add their Twitter
                handle and they'll be eligible to see your shared list as soon
                as they sign up.
              </p>

              The button triggers a popup that lets you log in with your Twitter

              it may be blocking the login popup. See if you can change your

              Honestly, I've seen a lot of people retweet very bad people
              because they've forgotten who that person is. However, this can be
              used for many positive purposes such as:

            <ol>
              <li>Remembering why you followed someone.</li>
              <li>
                Remembering who someone is (journalist? comedian?) despite their
                useless whimsical bio.
              </li>
              <li>Telling two similar people apart.</li>
              <li>
                Keeping track of people who keep screwing around with holiday
                themed names.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sharing useful info about who someone is, or why they are

                Chrome (desktop): This extension only works if/when you are
                browsing Twitter in the Chrome browser, on desktop. It won't
                work on the Twitter iPhone or Android apps, and it won't work in
                the Chrome browser on a phone.
              </li>
              <li>
                To create and save a list, you will need a Twitter account.

          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              Sure, signing up on the website lets you look at other people's
              lists they've shared with you. Anyone can look at public lists
              ("shared with everyone") without having an account.
            </p>
            <p>
              There's no UI to manually add entries if you're not coming from
              the extension but you could do it by messing around with the URL
              params. May add a UI for this in the future.

              I added that functionality but it's very tricky and I'm afraid

            <p>
              I'm collecting your twitter username and linking it to your
              twitlist account. I am also collecting all the notes you make on
              this app, obviously. I am not reading anything on your Twitter
              account. I know the login says I have access to your tweets and
              DMs but despite the fact I only want to use Twitter login
              verification and get your screenname, reading your account is the
              minimal amount of permissions a Twitter-integrated app can ask
              for.
