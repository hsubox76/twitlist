              <p>
                Honestly, I've seen a lot of people retweet very bad people because
                they've forgotten who that person is.  However, this can be used
                for many positive purposes such as:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Remembering why you followed someone.</li>
                <li>Remembering who someone is (journalist? comedian?) despite their useless whimsical bio.</li>
                <li>Telling two similar people apart.</li>
                <li>Keeping track of people who keep screwing around with holiday themed names.</li>
                <li>Sharing useful info about who someone is, or why they are famous, with your friends.</li>

                Chrome (desktop): This extension only works if/when you are
                browsing Twitter in the Chrome browser, on desktop. It won't
                work on the Twitter iPhone or Android apps, and it won't work in
                the Chrome browser on a phone.
              </li>
              <li>
                To create and save a list, you will need a Twitter account.

              There are two parts to Twitlist, the <strong>extension</strong>,
              and the <strong>website</strong>.

                You need to be using the Chrome browser.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Find the extension icon.</h3>
                <p>
                  Once the extension has been installed,
                  <strong>go to twitter.com</strong> and then look for this icon
                  in your top bar:
                </p>
                <img src="./twitlist_128.png" width="32" height="32" />
                <p>
                  Note that this icon won't appear if you're on any other
                  website!
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Log in to the extension.</h3>
                <p>
                  Click on the icon to open a popup. The popup will contain a
                  green button asking you to "sign in with Twitter". Do it! A
                  large popup will open to do the login. When it's done, it'll
                  go away and you should be logged in.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Check that the extension is working.</h3>
                <p>
                  Every tweet should have a little rectangular box under the
                  person's name that says "add a note about this user".
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Go to the website.</h3>
                <p>
                  To add your first note, click on any "add a note about this
                  user" link under a user's name. This will take you to the
                  website (twitlist.net). If it's your first time, and it should
                  be, you will be asked to log in again.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sorry about that, but it can't be helped, a website and an
                  extension are two different things. Going forward you probably
                  won't have to log in again, unless you deliberately log out.
                </p>

              <li>
                <h3>Add a note.</h3>
                <p>
                  Type your note about this user in the large input box, and
                  click "add note".
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Check that it worked.</h3>
                <p>
                  It should have added the first row to your list.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also, if you go back to your Twitter tab, this note should
                  appear on this user's tweets.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Set sharing options.</h3>
                <p>
                  Lists are set to private by default, which means no one else
                  can see your list. At the bottom, it should say, "This list
                  can be seen by" and the selected option should be "nobody".
                  The options are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>nobody</strong> This is the default.</li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>certain users (listed below)</strong> You can share
                    the list with other users by adding them in the "share with"
                    box at the bottom of this section. You need to use their
                    Twitter handle and they need to have registered with
                    Twitlist. If they haven't, you can still add their Twitter
                    handle and they'll be eligible to see your shared list as
                    soon as they sign up.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>everybody</strong> You'll get a public link to share
                    this list with anyone who visits that link.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

          <h2 class="question">Can I just sign up on the website and not use the extension?</h2>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              Sure, signing up on the website lets you look at other people's lists
              they've shared with you.  Anyone can look at public lists ("shared with everyone")
              without having an account.
            </p>
            <p>There's no UI to manually add entries if you're not coming from the extension
              but you could do it by messing around with the URL params.  May add a
              UI for this in the future.

            Can we set only certain entries to be private?

          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              I added that functionality but it's very tricky and I'm afraid
              something may go wrong. Maybe after all the existing bugs have
              been worked out!

              That seems like a lot of trouble.
